## Deployment Strategy

### Node.js Server Deployment
- **Main Server**: `server/simpleServer.js` - Primary entry point for deployment
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Comprehensive deployment compatibility with multiple wrappers:
  - `server.js` - Deployment wrapper for platforms expecting server.js
  - `app.js` - Application wrapper for Node.js deployments
  - `index.js` - Default Node.js entry point
  - `start.js` - Startup script wrapper
- **Deployment Strategy**: Works without npm scripts by using direct Node.js commands
- **Health Check**: Root endpoint (`/`) returns JSON health status for deployment monitoring
- **Port Configuration**: Environment-aware port configuration (process.env.PORT || 5000)
- **CORS Configuration**: Dynamic origin handling for replit.app domains and deployment
- **Static Assets**: Serves website files alongside API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL integration with Drizzle ORM
- **Procfile Support**: Heroku-style Procfile for platform compatibility
